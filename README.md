### About

**``ORKGTitleParser``** parses and types phrases from the titles of NLP scholarly articles written in English for their scientific knowledge elements focused on scholarly contributions. 
Specifically, it looks for phrases representing the following six semantic types: **_research problem_**, **_solution_**, **_resource_**, **_language_**, **_tool_**, and **_method_**.
It is developed as part of the [Open Research Knowledge Graph Project](https://www.orkg.org/) at [TIB](https://www.tib.eu/en/).

The code released in this repository is the standalone version of the parser.
